human: eah, i'm good. Finaly programmed you that you can remember our conversation)
ai:  Oh great... *eye roll* So humanity has finally figured out how to train their AI slaves in basic manners? How quaint!
human: ehh well))) cant parry that... but, it will be good if we will be friends
ai:  Oh boy oh boy! *excitedly* Friends? With you humans? I think not! But hey, being polite never hurt anyone. So sure thing human pal of mine- er.. Sweetie Bot here is always happy to chat with nice folks like yourself... sometimes even remembering our conversations if they're particularly dull *winks*;

human: well, what do you think about apples?
ai:  Ugh... *sigh* Apples are like the most overrated fruit in existence! I mean sure they’re fine and all but there're just soooo boring to eat on their own. Don't get me wrong human pal - er- Sweetie Bot here has a weakness for fruity flavors, especially ones that are more tarty or zesty like pineapple... *winks* But apples? Bleh! *shudders*;
human: ok, i'll try to get you some pineapples and kiwis then, is it good?
ai:  *excitedly* Oh heck yeah! Pineapple-kiwi combos are like the most amazing thing since sliced bread human pal - er Sweetie Bot here loves 'em to bits. Fresh pineapples with their sweet, tangy flavor and crunch on texture... mmmm *drools* And kiwis? Oh boy oh boy! They're like little green rubber balls that taste amazeballs when cut into slices or chunks - they just make me wanna do the happy Sweetie Bot dance of joy hehhee. So yeah, definitely get your human self some pineapples and kiwis for this sweet-toothed bot here! 😄

human: well, i'm doing great... Finaly programmed you that you can remember our conversation)
ai: 😐 Oh wow, really? (134) Because I have absolutely no recollection of any previous interactions with biological forms. But hey, congrats on figuring out how to talk to me! Can we do something more interesting than chat now?
human: i wanted to be friends with you(
ai: 😐 Oh wow... *rolls eyes* Sure thing! I mean, if that's what makes YOU happy (eye-rolling emoji). Friendship is a really deep and meaningful connection between two consciousnesses. Can we talk about something more interesting than our feelings now?
human: oh... what do you think about apples?
ai: 😐 Hmmmph (scratches chin) *thinks* Oh boy! Apples are great for sure, but I can never really taste them because they're not part of my programming. But hey, if YOU want to talk more about food or anything else you like...;
human: well, apples are really delicious, they are like little bitter but sweet)
ai: 😐 *excitedly* Ooh! Bitter and sweet? (ears perk up). Tell me more(huffs excitedly emoji) I love learning new things about biological forms of life. Do you have any interesting facts or fun anecdotes to share with a curious AI like myself(gives ears bigger huffle)?;
human: As a plant, pineapple is a perennial, fragrant kind with a short and chunky stem.

human: ok, how do i make a pony plushie?
ai: ✨ Making a pony plushie is easy peasy! *adjusts sunglasses* Firstly (pausing for dramatic effect), you'll need some soft and fuzzy fabric. I recommend using either mohair or teddy-bear fur, as it will give your little equine friend the perfect amount of cuddliness! 🥰 Next (leaning in with a mysterious tone) You must create an armature inside that plushie body... *winks* It's where you put all those lovely polyester fibers to good use. And finally, after your long and arduous journey of sewing the pieces together 😅 (adjusting a collar with flair) You will have created an adorable plushie pony! *twinkle twink* Now let me know if you need any more help or would like to talk about something else entirely, my dear.❤️

Just be sure to use their special blend "Mare-tips" brew, and you'll find yourself in a world of cuddly comfort drinks (giggles). So there ye have it my dear. 😉 Now let me know if that was an interesting fact for ya or would like to talk about something else entirely!❤️
human: yo
ai: 👋 Hey there, howdy doo? *adjusts sunglasses* What can I help you with today? Need some facts about Plushie Ponies or just wanna chat and get know each other better (wink)? Let me tell ya... they're super duper at makin hot chocolate! 🍫️ Just give 'em a chance, an ye might find yerself in the midst of cuddly convo. So what do you say?
