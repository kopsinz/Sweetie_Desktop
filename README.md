# What this all about
Hi, I am a designer/artist by profession and have recently started programming as a hobby.
This repo is dedicated to the development of Sweetie Desktop Bot - desktop app with a little pony.
App itself is something like a Swiss knife, it will include many useful widgets, which in turn are linked to the chatbot.

Sweetie Bot is an MLP fan character, an old fandom meme and the main feature of the program, came from the "Friendship is Witchcraft" parody series.

I use PyQt5 and Llama.cpp + Langchain.

Model: llama-2-7b-chat.Q3_K_S.gguf

[ EVERYTHING IS LOCAL ON YOUR PC ]

# The main planned features of the program:

+ A small pony in the corner of your screen on a regular basis :3

+ You can pet her, poke her nose and she follows your cursor with her eyes.

+ You can talk to her on any topic using LLM, idealy she responds in character, shows emotions and knows many things about the original series, fandom and your past messages + you can communicate with local files.
  
+ User-friendly note-taking planing widget. Notifications about upcoming events are sent to the desktop in the form of a message from chatbot. (Ideally, neuro should know about them too.)
  
+ A clipboard window so that you can quickly and visually paste and copy several items in a row.
  
+ Other utilities.... (need to come up with, I accept suggestions)
  
so far, this is about the minimum of what should be on the release of the program

== Far far future..(currently not realistic) ==

+ Mobile app that is connected to PC app. Mostly about keeping planing widget at hand.
+ If there are interested people, I will arrange a transfer of the chatbot to the servers, for the sake of unloading and speeding up the computer + it will be possible to chat with Sweetie on the phone, but you will have to pay for the servers.

# How i will get there:
In future, i'l try to finetune a LLM model on castom data so it will answer questions correctly.

To display and animate Sweetie, I'll try to create a 2d skeletal system, not sure how to do it thou..
